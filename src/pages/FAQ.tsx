    question: 'What is the safe level of hydrogen gas?',
    answer: 'The safe level of hydrogen gas is typically below 1.0 ppm (parts per million) in indoor environments. Levels above this threshold may require investigation and ventilation measures.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How often is the hydrogen level monitored?',
    answer: 'Our system continuously monitors hydrogen levels with readings taken every 5 minutes. This ensures real-time detection of any potentially dangerous situations.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What should I do if the system shows high levels?',
    answer: 'If the system detects levels above 1.0 ppm: 1) Evacuate the area immediately, 2) Ensure proper ventilation, 3) Contact your safety supervisor, and 4) Do not return until levels have normalized.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How accurate is the detection system?',
    answer: 'Our hydrogen detection system has an accuracy of Â±0.1 ppm and is calibrated regularly to ensure reliable measurements.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long is historical data stored?',
    answer: 'The system stores detailed historical data for up to 12 months, allowing for long-term trend analysis and compliance reporting.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I export the monitoring data?',
    answer: 'Yes, you can export monitoring data in various formats (CSV, PDF) from the History page. This feature is useful for record-keeping and analysis.'
